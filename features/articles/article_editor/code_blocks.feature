Feature: Adding code blocks when editing an article

  Background:
    Given the test user has the test book "test book 0" with the test article "test article 0"
    And I am logged in as the test user
    And I am editing the test article

  Scenario: Adding a code block with the "Code" button
    When I click the "Code" button
    And I fill in the article editor with '#include<iostream>;int main(){std::cout<<"Hello, world!";}'
    And I click the "Update Article" button
    And I refresh the page
    Then I should see a code block with syntax highlighting
